# Pure Python read only support for OBF files.

The OBF (and MSR) file format is used within my department quite frequently. The Imspector Python connection is limited to
a certain CPython version and OS system. To allow analysis everywhere I made a pure Python OBF content reader.

Use obf_support.py and see obf_support_example.py for an example.
